                    Shared hosting is suitable for most websites, especially for those starting out building an online presence. You are literally sharing server space with other websites hosted on the same network, but need no technical skills or background. A Dedicated server means you have the highest levels of security and protection as only your own website is being hosted, and includes root access to the network for optimum flexibility, but involves much higher costs and the need for technical expertise. A VPS might be a good middle ground for businesses who have high traffic and want faster speeds or added flexibility, but are not yet ready for the commitment of a Dedicated solution.

                    With so many initial costs involved with getting online, it can be hard to know what's worth the investment. Look at the direct and indirect costs of a web host. While it might be free in terms of initial outlay, are you going to be giving your visitors a less than professional experience in terms of pop ups and advertisements, or a sub-par page load time or even uptime overall? If so, the money you save in direct costs can indirectly cost far more in terms of loss of business and visitors in the long run.

            <h4 class="blue">How to Choose the Best Web Hosting Provider</h4>
            <p>Without the best web hosting, your ability to run a successful website is going to be seriously hindered. One of the worst mistakes you can make is to choose a web hosting provider at random. If there's a situation that calls for some thought, consideration and research, choosing a web hosting provider is it. There's a dizzying array of web hosting providers competing for your business. How can you pinpoint the best one? Start by keeping the following points in mind.</p>
            <h4 class="blue">Technical Specifications for Your Website Hosting</h4>
            <p>The first thing you need to do when shopping for a web host is to evaluate your disk space and bandwidth needs. If your site will feature a lot of graphics, dozens of pages and get a lot of traffic, you're going to need decent amounts of bandwidth and disk space. Unlimited plans are available, and they make life easier. If your site is going to be simple and not generate a huge amount of traffic, you should be able to get away with smaller amounts of disk space and bandwidth.</p>
            <p>Keep compatibility in mind, too. In the excitement of looking for a website hosting provider, you might overlook one critical thing: the type of operating systems that are supported. You're not going to want to switch operating systems, so double-check this point before settling for a provider.</p>
            <p>Reliability and availability are critical characteristics to consider when shopping around for web hosting. The best web hosting providers offer availability rates of 98 and 99 percent. This is frequently referred to as “Uptime”. It's easy to make such claims, though, so make sure to see if they make good on their promises.</p>
            <p>Security is also an essential concern. Choosing a web hosting provider without learning about its available security features is a big mistake. Things like firewalls, daily backups and user authentication should all be included. It's also nice to receive notifications whenever changes are made because they can alert you to suspicious activity.</p>
            <h4 class="blue">Get a Feel for Web Hosting Pricing & Value</h4>
            <p>Some people choose web hosting providers strictly based on price. That's not a great strategy, but you should definitely take pricing into consideration. The best providers offer options for every budget. In some cases, signing up for long subscriptions will qualify you for extra discounts.</p>
            <p>Also, try to leave yourself room to grow. It's great to choose a web hosting plan that suits your site's current needs. With any luck, though, your site will grow and expand over time. Your needs could change. Switching to a new web hosting provider is a major hassle, so look for one that offers scalable plans. In other words, you should be able to upgrade to another plan easily if necessary. Low prices are always great, but if the low price comes with limits on space or bandwidth, you want to make sure the deal is really worth it.</p>
            <p>In the same vein, you may want to note how many e-mail accounts are provided. Whether you think you'll need dozens of email addresses or not, it's nice to have the option to create as many as possible. In most instances, more expensive plans include larger numbers of email addresses. This feature isn't very important to some people, but it is critical to others.</p>
