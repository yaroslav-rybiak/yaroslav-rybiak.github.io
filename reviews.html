The pill is slightly less bitter as eHost offer services like $100’s of free advertising credit and free email accounts, something other providers in this space cash in on. They also offer a free domain for life, it is an appealing feature that is worthy of a thumbs up.</p>

                <p class="collapsible-link bold" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseFirst">
                    Should I choose Shared, VPS or Dedicated hosting?
                </p>
                <div class="collapse" id="collapseFirst">
                    Shared hosting is suitable for most websites, especially for those starting out building an online presence. You are literally sharing server space with other websites hosted on the same network, but need no technical skills or background. A Dedicated server means you have the highest levels of security and protection as only your own website is being hosted, and includes root access to the network for optimum flexibility, but involves much higher costs and the need for technical expertise. A VPS might be a good middle ground for businesses who have high traffic and want faster speeds or added flexibility, but are not yet ready for the commitment of a Dedicated solution.

                    Should I pay for website hosting?
                </p>
                <div class="collapse" id="collapseSecond">
                    With so many initial costs involved with getting online, it can be hard to know what's worth the investment. Look at the direct and indirect costs of a web host. While it might be free in terms of initial outlay, are you going to be giving your visitors a less than professional experience in terms of pop ups and advertisements, or a sub-par page load time or even uptime overall? If so, the money you save in direct costs can indirectly cost far more in terms of loss of business and visitors in the long run.
